		<h1>FIRE PREVENTION MONTH</h1>
		<h3 id="Q1">What is Fire Prevention Month?</h3>
		<p id="A1">March is considered to be one of the warmest months in the Philippines. According to PAGASA temperature and humidity reach their maximum levels throughout the archipelago. That is why it is also considered Fire Prevention Month by BFP. It is also the month with the most fire incidents in the country, prompting the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), government units, firefighting agencies, and educational institutions to conduct various fire prevention activities.</p>
		<h3 id="Q2"> How did it come to be?</h3>
		<p id="A2">By virtue of Proclamation No. 115-A, signed by then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos, and Proclamation No. 360 in 1986, the month of March was declared as “Fire Prevention Month” or “Burn Prevention Month.” The fire prevention month campaign, according to the measure, promotes “safety consciousness among our people every day of the year as a positive preventive approach to a problem that can be solved by more caution, vigilance, sobriety, the exercise of common sense, and respect for the law.”</p>
		<p id="A3">A total of 336 cases of fire incidents were recorded in 2022, slightly higher than the previous year wherein 333 cases of fire incidents were recorded, a report from the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP)-Bacolod said. January has the highest number of fire incidents with 53; followed by February with 47; May, 42; April, 39; November, 30; March, 25; October, 24; June, 23; September, 20; July and August, 12 each; and December, 9. The BFP reported that electrical post-fire topped the list with 102; followed by grassfire with 87; residential, 76; vehicle/special structure with 25; rubbish fire, 24; commercial, 8; storage, 5; business/government offices and industrial factory, 3 each; places of assembly, 2; and mixed-type occupancy, 1.</p>
